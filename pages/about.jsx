        <h2>Why do people love giphys?</h2>

        <p>
          Some people may work better with words, others with numbers, but
          everyone gets pictures. 90% of information transmitted to the human
          brain is visual.
        </p>

        <p>
          The old saying "a picture is worth a thousand words" is quite cliche.
          But that doesn't make it any less true, especially in marketing and
          particularly in the instant-gratification, short attention span world
          we live in today. Getting folks to retain (or even register) your
          messages and content or take action is harder than ever, especially if
          all you are giving them is words.
        </p>

        <p>
          Images are stronger than words. However, the fast-moving nature of
          GIFs make them stronger than images and their shorter length make them
          more digestible than video. That's the short answer.
